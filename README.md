# 📈 Stock Price Analysis & Portfolio Optimization Project

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes historical stock price data for the **top 5 most traded companies** (Apple, AMD, Bank of America, Ford, General Electric) to identify trends, volatility, correlations, and build an **optimized risk-return portfolio** using Python.

### 🔍 Key Objectives:
- Visualize stock price trends and moving averages.
- Analyze daily returns and volatility.
- Calculate correlations between stocks.
- Simulate 10,000 portfolios to find the **optimal allocation** with the highest Sharpe Ratio.
